 Project: Intro-5-Analog-Input          Activity: mirobo.tech/ubmp4-intro-5
 Date:    February 13, 2023
 
 This introductory programming activity for the mirobo.tech UBMP4 demonstrates
 an example use of analog input, number base conversion, and serial output
 functions making use of a simple, external serial function library. (Serial
 output is useful for debugging when using a logic analyzer, or an oscilloscope
 with a serial decode function.)
 
 Additional program analysis activities investigate the analog constants and
 input functions in the UBMP420.h and UBMP420.c files, as well as explore
 bit-wise AND operations for clearing and testing bits.

 * 
 * 1.   The TRISC register is originally set by the UBMP4_config() function, and
 *      is used to control the data direction (input, or output) of the PORTC
 *      I/O pins. A value of 0 in any TRIS register bit position configures the
 *      pin to be an output (0 is like 'o', for output), while a value of 1 sets
 *      the pin as an input (1 is like 'i', in input).
 * 
 *      What is the original value of TRISC set in UBMP4_config? How does the
 *      statement:
 * 
 *      TRISC = 0b00001100;
 * 
 *      in the main() function change the function of the PORTC I/O pins?
 * 
 * 2.   This program converts an analog input to a digital value representing
 *      the input, and outputs the digital bits to the PORTC pins connected to
 *      the UBMP4 header pins. A voltmeter can be used to read the result on
 *      the H1-H8 pins, except for H3 and H4. H3 and H4 have been set as inputs
 *      in this program since they connect to Q1 (an ambient light sensor or
 *      phototransistor) and U2 (an IR demodulator).
 * 
 *      If your UBMP4 has Q1 and U2 installed, leave the TRISC register as set,
 *      above. If Q1 and U2 are not installed, the TRISC register can be set to
 *      output on digital data on all of the header pins by changing it to:
 
    TRISC = 0b00000000;
 
 *      Read the conversion result by connecting a voltmeter between ground (the
 *      header pin closest to the circuit board edge -- marked with a ground
 *      symbol near the H1 legend) and each header signal pin (the header pin
 *      closest to the resistors -- marked with a pulse symbol).
 * 
 *      H1 is the least significant bit of the result, and H8 is the most
 *      significant bit. Starting at H8, record all 8 bits of the analog
 *      value, representing 5V as 1, and 0V as 0. What was your result?
 * 
 * 3.   The statement that outputs the digital value of the analog input to the
 *      header pins is: LATC = rawADC;
 * 
 *      Since the upper 4 bits of PORTC are also physically connected to LEDs
 *      D2-D5, they will light up to show these first four data bits as well.
 *      Does their value match your result, above?
 * 
 *      The lower 4 bits of the result can be displayed instead of the upper 4
 *      bits by shifting the contents of the ADC conversion result left,
 *      essentially sliding each bit 4 positions to its left. The upper 4 bits
 *      will be lost during this operation, and will be replaced by the lower
 *      4 bits.
 * 
 *      Update the LATC statement to match the statement, below. Rebuild the
 *      program and run it again.
 * 
        LATC = rawADC << 4;     // Shift result 4 bits to show low nybble on LEDs
 * 
 *      The least significant bits will be the ones that change most often. If
 *      you are using the built-in temperature sensor, try heating the micro-
 *      controller with your touch, or by cradling the circuit board in your
 *      hands until you see one or more bit changes indicated on the LEDs.
 * 
 * 4.   The PIC16F1459 microcontroller has 9 analog inputs shared with its
 *      digital I/O pins. Pins used for analog input must be explicity enabled
 *      as both input pins and analog pins. Describe how the ADC_config()
 *      function configures the Q1 pin for analog input.
 * 
 * 5.   The single ADC (analog-to-digital coverter) in the PIC16F1459 uses an
 *      input multiplexer (mux) to switch one analog input at a time to the ADC.
 *      After changing the input, a short delay is necessary to allow the input
 *      potential to settle before the conversion starts. The function call:
 * 
        ADC_select_channel(ANTIM);
 * 
 *      selects the microcontroller's on-board Temperature Indicator Module
 *      (ANTIM) as the ADC input. What other inputs are available? (Hint: see
 *      the UBMP420.h file)
 * 
 *      The ADC_select_channel() function does not add a delay after switching
 *      a new input to the ADC, but there is another function that switches
 *      inputs, adds a delay, and performs the analog to digital conversion.
 *      What is this function called? Why do you think it is not used here?
 * 
 * 6.   This program contains the bin_to_dec() function, which demonstrates a
 *      simple method of converting an 8-bit binary value to three decimal
 *      digits. Can you determine how it works? Explain, or use a flow chart
 *      to describe its operation.
 * 
 * 7.   Two serial data functions are included in the Simple-Serial.c file.
 *      These functions enable the program to output RS-232 formatted serial
 *      data on the H1 header pin. This allows a logic analyser or oscilloscope
 *      to be used to read the value of the serial data more conveniently and
 *      quickly than by successivley probing each of the header pins using a
 *      voltmeter.
 * 
 *      The format of the serial data is straightforward to understand. When no
 *      data is being transmitted, the serial line is 'idle', represented by a
 *      high, or 1 logic level.
 * 
 *      Every data transmission is preceeded by a low, or logic 0 level Start
 *      bit. Next, the data bits themselves are transmitted in order from LSB
 *      (least-significant bit) to MSB (most-significant bit). The transmission
 *      is ended with a logic 1 level Stop bit.
 * 
 *      The data bits, 0 or 1, are transmitted at a low or high voltage level,
 *      respectively, and each bit remains at its level for the entire bit
 *      duration (this is known as NRZ, or non-return-to-zero format). The bit
 *      duration is a reciprocal of the data rate. For example at 9600 bps
 *      (bits-per-second), each bit is 1/9600s, or roughly 104us (microseconds)
 *      in length.
 * 
 *      If you have access to an oscilloscope or logic analyzer, add the
 *      following code to the program (below the LATC output statement) to
 *      enable serial output. Then, probe H1 to view the serial data:
 
        // Write ADC result to H1 as binary serial data
        H1_serial_write(rawADC);
        
 *      Can you record or capture the digital serial data? What is the analogue
 *      value that it transmitted?
 * 
 * 8.   Rather than interpreting or converting the analogue value yourself, this
 *      next block of code can be added to your program to convert the analog
 *      result to three decimal digits, display each of the digits in ASCII
 *      format, and add the character codes signifying the end of a line of 
 *      text (CR) and the start of a new line of text (LF). Logic analysers or
 *      digital oscilloscopes may be able to decode these digits, or the output
 *      could be connected to a serial terminal to display the text.
 
        // Convert ADC result to decimal and write each digit serially in ASCII
        bin_to_dec(rawADC);
        H1_serial_write(dec2 + 0x30);   // Convert each digit to ASCII
        H1_serial_write(dec1 + 0x30);
        H1_serial_write(dec0 + 0x30);
        H1_serial_write(CR);            // Carriage return character
        H1_serial_write(LF);            // Line feed character
                
 * 
 * 9.   Both the H1_serial_config() function and the H1_serial_write() function
 *      make use of bit-wise AND (&) operators. Below is the AND operator used
 *      by the H1_serial_config() function:
 * 
        TRISC = TRISC & 0b11111110;
 * 
 *      Can you determine what this statement is doing, and why an AND operation
 *      is being used instead of just over-writing the TRISC value? Explain.
 * 
 * 10.  The data transmission loop of the H1_serial_write() function is shown
 *      below:
 * 
    // Shift 8 data bits out LSB first
    for(unsigned char bits = 8; bits != 0; bits--)
    {
        if((data & 0b00000001) == 0)    // Check the least significant bit state
        {
            H1OUT = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            H1OUT = 1;
        }
        __delay_us(103);    // Shorter delay to account for 'for' loop overhead
        data = data >> 1;   // Prepare next bit by shifting data right 1 bit pos
    }
 *  
 *      Explain how the AND operation used in the if condition can determine
 *      the state of the least significant data bit.
 * 
 *      After the least significant data bit is transmitted, how are the other
 *      bits in the data byte isolated and transmitted?
 *      
 * 
 * Programming Activities
 * 
 * 1.   The bin_to_dec() function converts a single byte into three decimal
 *      digits. Step 8 in the program analysis activities, above, converted
 *      each of these numeric digits to the ASCII code representing the digit.
 *      Can you make a bin_to_ASCII() function that would eliminate the need
 *      for you to offset the values to ASCII separately, as was done here?
 * 
 * 2.   Does your UBMP4 have Q1 installed? If installed, it will be easier to
 *      use Q1 as an input device instead of the temperature module. Q1 can
 *      either be an ambient light sensor, which is sensitive to visible light,
 *      or a phototransistor, sensitive to infrared (IR) wavelengths. Try using
 *      your phone's flashlight (ambient light sensor) or an infrared LED to
 *      illuminate Q1.
 * 
 *      Create a program to implement threshold detection. Determine the analog
 *      level when Q1 senses low light and again when Q1 senses bright light.
 *      Use conditional code to light an LED when the Q1 light level rises or
 *      falls beyond a threshold set in your program.
 * 
 * 3.   Create a program that produces a PWM output proportional to an analog
 *      input, or a program that creates a tone having a pitch proportional
 *      to an analog input value.
 * 
 * 4.   If you have an oscilloscope available, investigate how fast you get the
 *      serial output to transmit. Try setting the bit delays inside the serial
 *      write function to 1 microsecond of delay, instead of 104 and 103. Does
 *      it work the way it should? Is each bit 1us long? What do you think is
 *      happening?
 * 
 * 5.   Creating a function to transmit serial data is relatively straight-
 *      forward. Receiving serial data reliably is similar, but should take
 *      into account slight timing differences between the transmitter and 
 *      receiver. Think about how you would create a function to receive serial
 *      data. How could you ensure that the data is received correctly even if
 *      there are slight timing differences between the transmitting and
 *      receiving devices? Create the pseudocode or a flowchart describing a
 *      serial receive function.
 * 
 * 6.   Transmitting serial data involves isolating each bit of a variable to
 *      be sent using bit-wise logical operators, and bit-shifting the remaining
 *      data from within a loop. Received serial data can be assembled into an
 *      8-bit variable using a similar technique. Try to create a function or
 *      just the main loop of code that would successively read serial data
 *      from an input pin and assemble the values into an 8-bit variable.
